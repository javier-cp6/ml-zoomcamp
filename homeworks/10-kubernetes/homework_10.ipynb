    "In this homework, we'll deploy the credit scoring model from the homework 5.\n",

    "## Question 1\n",
    "\n",
    "Run it to test that it's working locally:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "docker run -it --rm -p 9696:9696 zoomcamp-model:hw10\n",

    "You need to install:\n",

    "\n",
    "Now let's create a cluster with `kind`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "kind create cluster\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "And check with `kubectl` that it was successfully created:\n",

    "```bash\n",
    "kubectl cluster-info\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 3\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's test if everything works. Use `kubectl` to get the list of running services. \n",
    "\n",
    "What's `CLUSTER-IP` of the service that is already running there? \n",

    "## Question 4\n",
    "\n",
    "To be able to use the docker image we previously created (`zoomcamp-model:hw10`),\n",

    "## Question 5\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's create a deployment config (e.g. `deployment.yaml`):\n",
    "\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "apiVersion: apps/v1\n",
    "kind: Deployment\n",

    "Apply this deployment using the appropriate command and get a list of running Pods. \n",
    "You can see one running Pod.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 6\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's create a service for this deployment (`service.yaml`):\n",
    "\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "apiVersion: v1\n",
    "kind: Service\n",
    "metadata:\n",
    "  name: <Service name>\n",

    "    targetPort: <PORT>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Fill it in. What do we need to write instead of `<???>`?\n",
    "\n",
    "Apply this config file.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Testing the service\n",
    "\n",
    "We can test our service locally by forwarding the port 9696 on our computer \n",
    "to the port 80 on the service:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "kubectl port-forward service/<Service name> 9696:80\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Run `q6_test.py` (from the homework 5) once again to verify that everything is working. \n",
    "You should get the same result as in Question 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Autoscaling\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we're going to use a [HorizontalPodAutoscaler](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/horizontal-pod-autoscale-walkthrough/) \n",
    "(HPA for short) that automatically updates a workload resource (such as our deployment), \n",
    "with the aim of automatically scaling the workload to match demand.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the following command to create the HPA:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "kubectl autoscale deployment credit --name credit-hpa --cpu-percent=20 --min=1 --max=3\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can check the current status of the new HPA by running:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "kubectl get hpa\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The output should be similar to the next:\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "`TARGET` column shows the average CPU consumption across all the Pods controlled by the corresponding deployment.\n",
    "Current CPU consumption is about 0% as there are no clients sending requests to the server.\n",
    "> \n",
    ">Note: In case the HPA instance doesn't run properly, try to install the latest Metrics Server release \n",

    "> ```bash\n",
    "> kubectl apply -f https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/metrics-server/releases/latest/download/components.yaml\n",
    ">```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Increase the load\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see how the autoscaler reacts to increasing the load. To do this, we can slightly modify the existing\n",
    "`q6_test.py` script by putting the operator that sends the request to the credit service into a loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",

    "\n",
    "Run `kubectl get hpa credit-hpa --watch` command to monitor how the autoscaler performs. \n",
    "Within a minute or so, you should see the higher CPU load; and then - more replicas. \n",
