    "### Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "In this homework, we will use the Car price dataset. Download it from [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alexeygrigorev/mlbookcamp-code/master/chapter-02-car-price/data.csv).\n",
    "\n",
    "Or you can do it with `wget`:\n",

    "### Features\n",
    "\n",
    "For the rest of the homework, you'll need to use only these columns:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `Make`,\n",

    "\n",
    "Create the [correlation matrix](https://www.google.com/search?q=correlation+matrix) for the numerical features of your dataset. \n",
    "In a correlation matrix, you compute the correlation coefficient between every pair of features in the dataset.\n",

    "### Make `price` binary\n",
    "\n",
    "* Now we need to turn the `price` variable from numeric into a binary format.\n",
    "* Let's create a variable `above_average` which is `1` if the `price` is above its mean value and `0` otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Split the data\n",
    "\n",
    "* Split your data in train/val/test sets with 60%/20%/20% distribution.\n",
    "* Use Scikit-Learn for that (the `train_test_split` function) and set the seed to `42`.\n",
    "* Make sure that the target value (`price`) is not in your dataframe.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 3\n",
    "\n",
    "* Calculate the mutual information score between `above_average` and other categorical variables in our dataset. \n",
    "  Use the training set only.\n",
    "* Round the scores to 2 decimals using `round(score, 2)`.\n",

    "\n",
    "* Now let's train a logistic regression.\n",
    "* Remember that we have several categorical variables in the dataset. Include them using one-hot encoding.\n",
    "* Fit the model on the training dataset.\n",
    "    - To make sure the results are reproducible across different versions of Scikit-Learn, fit the model with these parameters:\n",
    "    - `model = LogisticRegression(solver='liblinear', C=10, max_iter=1000, random_state=42)`\n",

    "### Question 5 \n",
    "\n",
    "* Let's find the least useful feature using the *feature elimination* technique.\n",
    "* Train a model with all these features (using the same parameters as in Q4).\n",
    "* Now exclude each feature from this set and train a model without it. Record the accuracy for each model.\n",
    "* For each feature, calculate the difference between the original accuracy and the accuracy without the feature. \n",
    "\n",
    "Which of following feature has the smallest difference?\n",

    "- `city_mpg`\n",

    "> **Note**: the difference doesn't have to be positive\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 6\n",
    "\n",
    "* For this question, we'll see how to use a linear regression model from Scikit-Learn.\n",
    "* We'll need to use the original column `price`. Apply the logarithmic transformation to this column.\n",
    "* Fit the Ridge regression model on the training data with a solver `'sag'`. Set the seed to `42`.\n",
    "* This model also has a parameter `alpha`. Let's try the following values: `[0, 0.01, 0.1, 1, 10]`.\n",
    "* Round your RMSE scores to 3 decimal digits.\n",
    "\n",
    "Which of these alphas leads to the best RMSE on the validation set?\n",
